# Theme Description

In this theme the Functional RoadBot constantly works to assess the road and tries to work on the
construction zone as swiftly as possible. The arena is an abstraction of a road area that requires
maintenance.
Controlled using Raspberry Pi and programmed in Elixir [Elixir is a Functional Programming language
which helps in the efficient utilisation of multiple cores in Raspberry Pi], the RoadBot searches for faulty
road segments and provides service by filling potholes with the dispensing mechanism and operates
following the traffic on a specific road segment.
